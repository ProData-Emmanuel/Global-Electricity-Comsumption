#### TITLE: Understanding the Amazon Rainforests from Space.
#### OBJECTIVES: Image Classification task of satellite image chips of the Amazon Rainforests: 
	    This project aims to build artificial intelligence algorithms to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use.  For this multiclass-multilabel problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: cloud cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze), primary rainforest, water (rivers, lakes), habitation (large city, small homes), agriculture, roads etc. 
	    The algorithms from this project will enable us to understand where, how and why deforestation happens.

#### METHOD:
In this project, custom deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architecture is combined with a pre-trained CNN architecture (VGG16) and implemented in Keras with Tensorflow backend.
